# Introduction

It is important to know that the most cancers are what we call **sporadic cancers**, these are isolated cases of cancer that are caused by
   * age
   * lifestyle 
   * environment 
   
Not by genetic risk factors.

 People who have sporadic cancers and their families have an average chance of getting cancer themselves and can follow the usual recommendations for cancer prevention and monitoring.

 A smaller group of families have what we call **hereditary cancer** in these families there is a strong inherited risk factor for cancer and  this is stronger than lifestyle and environment although life style and environment are still important.

 Hereditary cancer is not common but it is important to find these families because some people in the family have a higher chance of getting cancer, their information we can use to offer people medical care that can help them prevent cancer or catch it early.

We have two tools to find families with hereditary cancer 
  * Family history 
  * Genetic testing 

 It is important to use both family history and genetic testing together because each of them gives us different kinds of information and by putting them together we can have the most accurate picture of someone chances of getting cancer.

 Let’s take a closure look at **family history** in families with **sporadic cancer** and those with **hereditary cancer**

|Sporadic                                    |Hereditary                                    |
|--------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
|  - Cancer at later ages.                   |  - Cancer at young ages.                     |  
|  - Few people in the family who had cancer.|  - Multiple family members.                  |
|  - Different types of cancer.              |  - Same or related types of cancer.          |
|                                            |  - Rare cancers                              |

**Genetic testing** can help us to get more information as you may know we inherit from our mother in an egg and our father in a sperm a complete set of genetic information for how our body will grow and develop there are thousands of different genes and each gene is a set of instructions for something specific.

 The genes we are look at in hereditary cancer are called **tumor suppressor genes** and it have a normal job in our body which is helping to control how our cells grow and protect us from developing cancer.

 We have two copies of each tumor suppressor gene one from our mother and one from our father e.g. **BRCA1** and **BRCA2** genes **involved in hereditary breast and ovarian cancer**.

In families with hereditary cancer one of these important tumor suppressor genes is not working properly the technical word that we use for this is a **mutation**.

 A good analogy is making a spelling mistake in a set of instructions, a spelling mistake in the instructions is the same as a mutation in a tumor suppressor gene the body can’t use that information any more to protect us from getting cancer.

 Someone who has a mutation in a tumor suppressor gene is not automatically develop cancer, in fact most of these people will not get cancer for many years or may be never at all that’s because we have two copies of each of these genes and the copy from other parent can still work to protect us from getting cancer.

 While we have been using the term hereditary cancer it’s more accurate to say people with a mutation in a tumor suppressor gene have a hereditary predisposition to cancer, this is a long way of saying they have a higher chance of developing cancer than other people.

 We don’t do genetic testing just to tell people that they have a higher chance of getting cancer, we do genetic testing to find people who have a higher chance of getting cancer, so that we can offer them options for cancer monitoring and cancer prevention that are specific to them.
